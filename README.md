# <p align=center> Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023 Azure Edition

## The [Terraform Beginner Bootcamp](https://terraform.cloudprojectbootcamp.com/) was a 2-week bootcamp that teached the fundamentals of Terraform utilising AWS services centred around a cloud project. This bootcamp strongly focused on hands-on experience. 

## This project is my Azure edition, it utilises Azure services in place of AWS services.


# <p align=center> Cloud Project: TerraTowns

## [TerraTowns](https://terratowns.cloud/) is a community website where bootcamp participants (terraformers) launch their own Terra Home (a user-created website) and connect their home to a Town for other Terraformers to view. This is similar to GeoCities circa 2001.
